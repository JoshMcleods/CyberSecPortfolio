# CyberSecPortfolio

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented 2nd year university student studying to be a cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.
